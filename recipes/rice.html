    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown lentils</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt or to taste</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 medium onions (more if you love onions)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preperation:</h2>
    <p>
        Start boiling some water for use later. <br>
        Wash lentils and put in large cooking pot with 2 cups cold water. <br>
        Add carrots and garlic. Bring to boil, lower heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. <br>
        While lentils cook, start soaking the rice. <br>
        Place rice in heat-resistant bowl, cover with boiling water and stir. Soak rice for about 15 minutes. <br>
        Drain rice well and mix with the cooked lentils and 1½ cups hot water. <br>
        Add cumin, salt and pepper. <br>
        Cover and simmer until all water is absorbed, about 15 minutes or longer. <br>
        While rice and lentils cook, halve the onions vertically and slice thinly. <br>
        Fry onions in the olive oil until golden brown. <br>
        Transfer the mujaddara to a platter and top with the fried onion. <br>
        Serve with a Simple Arabic Salad and Yogurt Cucumber Salad or simply plain yogurt. <br>
